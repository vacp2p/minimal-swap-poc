# README

A minimal end to end proof of concept of using Swap contracts written by Swarm
and maintained here: https://github.com/ethersphere/swap-swear-and-swindle

All significant code imported from the above repo. Only minor adjustments to
hooking things up and illustrates things in a minimal fashion.

## Running

Ensure you have truffle and Ganache installed. Ganache should be running.

## TODOs

- Import contracts and run migrations
- Setup basic UI
- Showcase basic chequebook end to end (deposit, show balance, withdraw)
- Get basic cheque sending working (web3 provider, util code)
- Showcase swap basic operation for two nodes
